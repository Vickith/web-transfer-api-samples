Contact Signiant Support for help.\r\n\r\n### Signiant.Mst.Upload\r\nThis class extends Signiant.Mst.Transfer. \r\n\r\nThis object allows you to perform an accelerated upload using the Transfer API. The Signiant.Mst.Upload object exposes functions to accomplish things such as choosing the files/folders to be uploaded, setting the destination for the uploaded files/folders, configuring the authentication credentials for the destination server, etc. \r\n\r\nOne Signiant.Mst.Upload object must be created per upload.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\ntransferObject = new Signiant.Mst.Upload();\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Methods\r\n#clearFiles \r\nThis will clear the files/folders specified in the filesArray parameter, from the list of files to be uploaded. The files/folders must be specified using their full paths in the filesArray parameter. An exception is thrown if the filesArray parameter is undefined or datatype of filesArray is not an Array.\r\n```javascript\r\nclearFiles(filesArray)\r\n```\r\n\r\n#clearAllFiles\r\nClears all the files from the list of files to be uploaded.\r\n```javascript\r\nclearAllFiles \r\n```\r\n\r\n#chooseUploadFiles\r\nThis function launches the platform-specific file-chooser so that the user can select the files/folders to be uploaded.  Once the user has selected the desired files/folders the callbackFunction is invoked. If the user did not select any files/folders, the callbackFunc is not invoked.\r\n```javascript\r\nchooseUploadFiles(callbackFunction) \r\n```\r\nreturns\r\n```\r\ncallbackFunction(eventType,selectedFiles)\r\n```\r\nselectedFiles is a JSON array of objects\r\n```javascript\r\n{ \r\n  \"name\":\"upload.txt\",\r\n  \"path\":\"/tmp/upload.txt\",\r\n  \"isDirectory\":\"false\",\r\n  \"size\":\"10190\"\r\n}\r\n\r\n# setFilesToUpload\r\nStarts the upload of the specified files/folders to the destination server.  If the specified API key is not valid, or if the Signiant App is not installed, an exception is thrown. This function simply notifies the Signiant App to begin the transfer, and then returns. Further notifications related to the state/progress of the transfer can be retrieved by registering event listeners with the subscribeForBasicEvents and subscribeForTransferProgress functions.",
